# Data Science Capstone Project - Predicting parkrun results

This project was completed as part of the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly in December 2020.

## Background

[Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) organise free weekly timed runs, delivered by local volunteers, in 20 different countries globally.  People of all abilities are encouraged to run, walk or jog 5km at their local course with events taking place every Saturday morning.  Results are published online shortly afterwards.  Parkrun started in 2004 and now has 672 locations in the UK alone.  To date over 2.3 million unique participants have crossed the finish line a total of 34.8 million times.  As a keen parkrunner I saw this as a great dataset to explore.

## Goals

Volunteering at parkrun is great fun but most regulars would agree that the job of timekeeper is the most stressful.  The busiest events can have over 2000 participants on a busy day, with most crossing the finishing line in a 45 minute window.  Even with experienced volunteers who are speedy on the stopwatch buttons, sometimes things can and do go wrong.

**Can we train a model to predict finish times and replace the stopwatch?**
